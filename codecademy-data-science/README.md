# ‚ùÑ Data Science path on Codecademy

This folder contains codes & "my-way descriptions" when I follow [Data Science path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science) on Codecademy.

**Note**: Unlike my notes for [dataquest](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dataquest-aio) or [deelearning.ai](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/deeplearning.ai-notes), this folder only contains the important codes & nodes (for me).

‚ùóüíÄ‚ùó For the reason of efficiency, I drop this path. It takes more time (and a little useless) to learn some basic tasks. I change to learn from more advanced courses.
