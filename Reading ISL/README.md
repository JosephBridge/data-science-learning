All assignments I've done in the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirami.

The files `chapXX_concentual.ipynb` contains **Conceptual** exercises' solution and files `chapXX_applied.ipynb` contains **Applied** exercises' solution (in Python instead of R).
