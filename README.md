# data-science-learning

The list of things I've finished so far on the way of learning by myself Machine Learning and Data Science. I use [rawnote.dinhanhthi.com](http://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com) to catch up with all of the things on the first day I meet them and use [note.dinhanhthi.com](http://note.dinhanhthi.com) for more well-written notes.

- [x] numpy, matplotlib, pandas -- w.r.t. all algorithms I've learned and projects I've done so far.
- [ ] [Keras](https://keras.io/).
- [ ] [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

## Programming Languages

- [x] SQL.
- [ ] [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
- [ ] [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)

## Frameworks

- [ ] [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/).
- [ ] [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).
- [ ] [D3js](https://d3js.org/).

## Projects

### Mini-projects for understanding the concepts

You can find **the html files** (exported from the corresponding Jupyter Notebook) and **"Open in Colab" files** for below mini projects [here](https://note.dinhanhthi.com/small-projects-to-understand-concepts).

- [x] Image compression using K-Means.
- [x] Example to understand the idea of PCA.
- [x] Image compression using PCA.
- [x] PCA without scikit-learn.
- [x] Face Recognition using SVM.
- [x] XOR problem using SVM to see the effect of gamma and C in the case of using RBF kernel.

## Courses

The "non-checked" courses are under the way to be finished!

- [x] [**Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andew NG on Coursera. It introduces a general idea about ML and some commonly used algorithms. [My note](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/tags#ml-coursera) for this course.
- [x] **[IBM Data Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate)** specialization on Coursera. It contains 9 sub-courses covering fundamental knowledge about data science. [My note](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/tags#ibm-data) for this course.
- [ ] **[Data Scientist](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist)** path & **[Data Engineer](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-engineer/)** path on Dataquest. Both of them contain many sub-courses covering all about Data Science. [My note](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/tags#dataquest) for this course.
- [ ] **[Data Science Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science)** on Codecademy. It contains 27 sub-courses covering all necessary knowledge about data science.
- [ ] **[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)** by Andrew NG on Coursera. It contains 5 courses covering the foundations of Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization,...). Many case studies projects are proposed.
- [ ] [**fast.ai**'s courses](https://www.fast.ai/) for Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
