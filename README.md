# data-science-learning

The list of things I've finished so far on the way of learning by myself Machine Learning and Data Science. I use [rawnote.dinhanhthi.com](http://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com) to catch up with all of the things on the first day I meet them and use [note.dinhanhthi.com](http://note.dinhanhthi.com) for more well-written notes.

## Algorithms

- [x] Linear Regression / Logistic Regression -- [my note](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/search?q=linear+regression)).
- [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- [x] Decision Tree -- [my note](https://note.dinhanhthi.com/search?q=decision+tree).
- [x] Random Forest -- my note.
- [x] Principal Component Analysis (PCA) -- [my note](https://note.dinhanhthi.com/principal-component-analysis).

## Libraries

- [x] [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
- [x] [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
- [ ] [Keras](https://keras.io/).
- [ ] OpenCV.

## Courses

- [x] [**Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andew NG on Coursera. It introduces a general idea about ML and some commonly used algorithms. [My note](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/tags#ml-coursera) for this course.
- [x] **[IBM Data Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate)** specialization on Coursera. It contains 9 sub-courses covering fundamental knowledge about data science. [My note](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/tags#ibm-data) for this course.
- [ ] **[Data Scientist](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist)** path & **[Data Engineer](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-engineer/)** path on Dataquest. Both of them contain many sub-courses covering all about Data Science. [My note](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/tags#dataquest) for this course.
- [ ] **[Data Science Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science)** on Codecademy. It contains 27 sub-courses covering all necessary knowledge about data science.
- [ ] **[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)** by Andrew NG on Coursera. It contains 5 courses covering the foundations of Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization,...). Many case studies projects are proposed.
- [ ] [**fast.ai**'s courses](https://www.fast.ai/) for Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
