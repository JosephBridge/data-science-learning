The goal is to build a binary classifier based on the attached corpus. Documents are classified as either belonging to the desired class (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

We would simply like you to have a look at the data and come up with one or several strategies to build such a classifier and maximize its accuracy. 

This may include suggestions on how to pre-process, vectorize or resample the data or how to evaluate the classifier. 

If time permits, code samples (in the language of your choice) in which you implement and evaluate your different strategies would be appreciated.
